Tested in gnome-shell 40.5 and 42.alpha, should works in gnome 40 and 41.

integrate the blur effects with rounded corners.The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/yilozt/mutter).

__Issues__:

- It can be buggy with blur effect. see [https://github.com/aunetx/blur-my-shell](https://github.com/aunetx/blur-my-shell). If you are using Intel driver in Xorg session, try create `.drirc` in your home directory to disable Vertical Synchronization: 
  ```xml
  <device screen="0" driver="dri2">
      <application name="Default">
          <option name="vblank_mode" value="0"/>
      </application>
  </device>
  ```
  ## For Nvidia and AUR
  - you need to do makepkg --nocheck -si or it will fail the checks at the end.

- The original shadows of rounded windows has been cutted out, now use `MetaShadowFactroy` to draw shadows for rounded windows. So the animation effect of shadows in some themes has gone. 

# Install

## Arch Linux

install `mutter-rounded` by AUR helper:

```bash
yay -S mutter-rounded
```

## Ubuntu 21.10

There is a simple script to help you build the packages in ubuntu 21.10. It's neccesary to check the content of script. Before you build the packages, the `Source code` checkbox in `Software & Updates` should be enabled:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yilozt/mutter-rounded
cd ./mutter-rounded/ubuntu_21.10
./package.sh
sudo dpkg -i *.deb
```

## Fedora 35 and Rawhide

There are pre-build packages which built by [@gregor160300](https://github.com/gregor160300), you can download packages from [https://gregor160300.stackstorage.com/s/I4YFXu82ay6mNE0C/en_US](https://gregor160300.stackstorage.com/s/I4YFXu82ay6mNE0C/en_US).

Alternatively, you can build packages by yourself with scripts in `fedora_35` folder. It's neccesary to check the contents in scripts before you run it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yilozt/mutter-rounded
# For Fedora 35
cd ./mutter-rounded/fedora_35
# For Fedora 36 (Rawhide)
